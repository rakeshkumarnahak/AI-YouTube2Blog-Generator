You've been a part of so many governments. Is there anything you can tell all of us which would give us a little better understanding? Because so much is known about Narendra Modi. But is there some insight that you can share with us about what it's like, how it is different from other people. Is a strong leader, is a modern in outlook. Very progressive. Now reforms has been started in 1991 with Internet Revolution. Technology has become handy for us by using all these things. If you see next level revolution or development. Narendra Modi Ji has done with consistent efforts. Otherwise this type of development we cannot see. If you see now globally all countries are facing aging problem or growth is very nominal. Only the country is growing 7.58%. Only India. That is the strength of India under its leadership. I am confident there is a scope further. All of us will work together. 10% plus we can grow. No other country is having this advantage. I'll get back to the population question later because. Because I know you have lots of ideas about it. But I. When you were talking about working with the pm Are you also able to make it like change his mind in certain ways. I know that the tdp I. I read your statement before. You said that if something we put our point of view forward. So in coalition, sir, are you able to influence them change their mind about certain things? No, we are working with them for this great nation. I can say very clearly no need to influence anybody. But we have to work together. Whenever he's having great ideas. Not only endorsing, we will strengthen his efforts. That is where his leader will follow him. Will work with him for logical conclusion. That is what I'm saying. One of the new things of course sir that has happened is NDA is meeting much more like we saw the Chandigarh meeting. You were there. You came down from Chandigarh. At that time they had a meeting with. And I believe one of the things that they said the difference in this term is going to be. We will keep consulting with allies. Much more. No, that is one another thing is always working for next election. Next election. That is. That is the beauty. If you see Chandigarh. All of us has thought it is only swearing and ceremony. After that we can leave. Then he informed all India Chief Ministers with PM will meet. Then 4 hours uninterrupted meeting he conducted. He listened everybody's views finally summed up. That is his determination that the leadership is providing. That is the great leadership. I can say so at that time you were planning for 2029. That is what I am saying. Already planned for 2029. We did not know that. That is how he is working. Just like mission.\"\n\nHTML Response: ",

He specifically highlighted India's impressive 7.58% growth rate, a feat unmatched by other global economies grappling with aging populations and slower growth.  Naidu expressed confidence in India's potential for even greater growth, aiming for a 10%+ rate.</p>\n\n    <p>The transcript reveals Naidu's admiration for Modi's consistent efforts in driving reform and development, particularly emphasizing the leveraging of technology and the continuation of reforms initiated in 1991.  This positive assessment paints a picture of  Modi's leadership as strong, modern, and progressive.</p>\n\n    <h2>Collaboration and Influence within the NDA</h2>\n    <p>When asked about his ability to influence the Prime Minister's decisions within the NDA coalition, Naidu clarified that their collaboration focuses on working together for the nation's betterment. He stated that influencing wasn't necessary, but rather a collaborative effort of strengthening Modi's initiatives and working towards a common goal. This suggests a cooperative, rather than confrontational, relationship within the alliance.</p>\n\n\n    <h2>The NDA's Evolving Dynamics</h2>\n    <p>Naidu noted a significant shift in the NDA's functioning, particularly highlighting the increased consultations with allies.  He used the example of the Chandigarh meeting, where a 4-hour uninterrupted session allowed for open dialogue and the incorporation of diverse viewpoints.  This emphasizes a more inclusive and consultative approach within the ruling coalition.</p>\n\n\n    <h2>Naidu's Long-Term Strategy: Planning for 2029</h2>\n    <p>One of the most striking revelations from the conversation is Naidu's confirmation of his preparations for the 2029 elections.  This proactive and forward-looking approach underscores his long-term political vision and strategic planning. The statement was made in the context of Modi's own proactive approach to governance and his focus on long-term goals, highlighting a shared approach among the leaders. This early planning suggests a significant commitment to future political engagement.</p>\n\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>The conversation between Naidu and Choudhury provides valuable insights into the dynamics of Indian politics.  Naidu's praise for Modi's leadership, coupled with his own strategic preparations for the 2029 elections, highlights the complexities and long-term perspectives at play in the current political landscape.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n",
